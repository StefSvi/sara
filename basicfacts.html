      <h2>Basic Facts About Mediation</h2>
      <p>
        What is Mediation? Mediation is a voluntary, confidential process in
        which a neutral mediator assists parties in negotiating a mutually
        acceptable resolution of their dispute. Why would parties choose
        mediation to resolve a dispute? Mediation offers many advantages. A good
        mediator reminds the parties of mutual areas of agreement. Mediators
        explain that it’s okay to be concerned about your own needs, and that
        it’s possible to consider your own needs and at the same time consider
        the needs of others (this is called the Dual Concern Model). Mediators
        helps parties shift from reviewing the past to looking toward the
        future. They help create mutually agreed-upon agreements that stand the
        test of time.

      <h3><b>Advantages of mediation:</b></h3><br>
      <p>
        1. <b>Confidentiality: </b> Unlike legal proceedings, mediation is
        confidential.<br /><br>

        2. <b>Control: </b> During mediation, parties control the process and
        help design their own agreement.<br /><br>

        3. <b>Efficiency: </b> Mediation saves time and money.
        <br /><br>

        4. <b>Creativity: </b>Mediation allows parties to bring their own
        solutions to the table, which will result in more durable, satisfying
        agreements.
        <br /><br>

        5. <b>Long term outcomes: </b> Mediation is more collaborative and less
        adversarial, which allows parties to move forward faster. <br /><br>

        6. <b>Effective: </b> Settlements that are reached after mediation have
        higher compliance rates than those from court-appointed judgments.<br /><br>

        7. <b>Relationships: </b>Existing relationships can be preserved.
        Mediation allows parties to look to the future and, if the parties wish,
        establish stronger, more cooperative relationships.
