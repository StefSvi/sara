      <h2>Common Questions</h2>

      <p>
        <b>What is mediation? </b><br /><br />
        Mediation is a voluntary, confidential process in which a neutral
        mediator assists parties in negotiating a mutually acceptable resolution
        of their dispute. The mediator is present to facilitate constructive,
        respectful communication.<br /><br />
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Why would parties choose mediation to resolve a dispute? </b
        ><br /><br />
        Mediation offers many advantages. Mediators remind the parties of mutual
        areas of agreement, and explain that itâ€™s possible to consider your own
        needs and at the same time consider the needs of others. Mediation is an
        opportunity for everyone involved to express their opinions and
        concerns. Mediators help parties shift from reviewing the past to
        looking toward the future. They help create mutually agreed-upon
        agreements that stand the test of time.<br /><br />
      </p>

      <p>
        <b> Is mediation the same as therapy? </b><br /><br />
        No. While mediation supports people as they express their needs and
        emotions, the aim of mediation is to make decisions that will allow
        parties to move forward. <br /><br />
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>How long does the mediation process last? </b><br /><br />
        Private mediation sessions are one-hour long, while family sessions are
        typically two or three hours long, depending on the number of
        participants and the level of complexity. Resolving disputes can take
        anywhere from one or two sessions, to closer to a dozen. Most of the
        time, the process is complete after two or three months.<br /><br />
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>How long does conflict coaching last? </b><br /><br />
        Conflict coaching usually takes anywhere from one or two sessions to a
        dozen. These sessions are one-hour long.<br /><br />
      </p>

      <p>
        <b>Are the decisions made in mediation legally binding? </b><br /><br />
        No. There are no judges or juries in a mediation. In mediation, the
        parties are empowered to determine their own outcomes. These agreements
        are not legally binding. Once agreement is reached, attorneys can make
        legally binding documents.<br /><br />

      <p><b>Advantages of mediation:</b></p>
      <br />
      <p>
        1. <b>Confidentiality: </b> Unlike legal proceedings, mediation is
        confidential.<br /><br />

        2. <b>Control: </b> During mediation, parties control the process and
        help design their own agreement.<br /><br />

        3. <b>Efficiency: </b> Mediation saves time and money. <br /><br />

        4. <b>Creativity: </b>Mediation allows parties to bring their own
        solutions to the table, which will result in more durable, satisfying
        agreements. <br /><br />

        5. <b>Long term outcomes: </b> Mediation is more collaborative and less
        adversarial, which allows parties to move forward faster. <br /><br />

        6. <b>Effective: </b> Settlements that are reached after mediation have
        higher compliance rates than those from court-appointed judgments.<br /><br />

        7. <b>Relationships: </b>Existing relationships can be preserved.
        Mediation allows parties to look to the future and, if the parties wish,
        establish stronger, more cooperative relationships.
