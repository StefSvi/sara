        Conflict can arise at any time. But there are certain situations and
        stages of life which may benefit from a mediator. A neutral third party
        can help navigate through these periods of high conflict, as well as
        build skills that can sustain change.

        <br /><br />
        <b>Difficult conversations between siblings:</b> Siblings are most
        people’s longest- lasting relationship. Many siblings are close, but
        even then, that does not mean that there won’t be areas of dispute.
        There are sometimes differences in approaches to caring for elderly
        parents, disputes over the division of an estate, friction caused by
        siblings and spouses, and other areas that can put strain on the
        relationship.

        <br /><br />
        <b>Family business mediation and “prenups” for family businesses:</b
        >Family businesses can be tricky, especially when it comes to the issue
        of succession. Mediation can help untangle family dynamics, as well as
        anticipate and resolve the complex issues that sometimes result in
        family business disputes. BMC can be a resource to navigate a prenup for
        a new family business. What issues might arise in the future that can be
        anticipated and resolved before it comes personal, intractable, and
        damaging?

        <br /><br />
        <b>Parents struggling to set limits with teenagers:</b>Mediation can
        support teens and their parents to help improve boundary setting,
        communication, and mutual respect. This high-conflict period can be
        draining, and building a toolbox filled with coping strategies and
        collaboratively constructed agreements can help support families.

        <br /><br />
        <b>Disputes between friends:</b>Where can longtime friends turn when
        there is a bump in the friendship? Sometimes disputes are caused by
        spouse or siblings, or differences in values around money. Mediation
        offers a space to resolve the issues and move forward constructively.

        <br /><br />
        <b>Elder care and end of life decisions:</b>These conversations are
        undoubtably difficult, but at the same time critical. Adult siblings
        often need to find ways to work with aging parents, some of whom might
        have diminished capacities, or a desire to ignore the inevitable.
        Mediation offers a valuable resource and hope for efficient, productive
        conversations.

        <br /><br />
        <b>Ongoing financial support of adult high-needs children:</b>Whether a
        child has special needs or hasn’t left “the nest” at the appropriate
        time, this situation can cause an inordinate amount of stress and
        conflict for siblings and parents. Mediation can support families during
        these difficult situations.

        <br /><br />
        <b>Conflict coaching:</b>This is a one-on-one process to help an
        individual develop conflict resolution skills such as listening,
        empathizing, and problem solving. Transparency is often a critical part
        of mediation, and in a one-on-one setting, clients can learn to
        appreciate its value. If someone feels stuck in a conflict, sometimes
        individual coaching can lead to growth and change.
