                Conflict can arise at any time. But there are certain situations
                and stages of life which may benefit from a mediator. A neutral
                third party can help navigate through these periods of high
                conflict, as well as build skills that can sustain change.

                <b>Mediating Difficult Conversations Between Siblings: </b>
                Siblings are most people’s longest-lasting relationship. Many
                siblings are close, but even then, that does not mean that there
                won’t be areas of dispute. There are sometimes differences in
                approaches to caring for elderly parents, disputes over the
                division of an estate, friction amongst siblings and spouses,
                and other areas that can put strain on these relationships. With
                a mix of one-on-one private meetings and family meetings, we
                will identify areas of concern, work to see different
                perspectives, lay the groundwork for productive conversations,
                and collaborate on new ways of moving forward.

                    >Mediating Family Businesses and Creating “Prenups” for
                    Family Businesses:</b
                >
                Family businesses can be tricky, especially when it comes to the
                issue of succession. Mediation can help untangle family
                dynamics, as well as anticipate and resolve the complex issues
                that sometimes result in family business disputes. Manhattan
                Mediation can be a resource to navigate a prenup for a new
                family business. What issues might arise in the future that can
                be anticipated and resolved before it comes personal,
                intractable, and damaging? Our work together will focus on
                creating clarity, generating respect, and greater collaboration.

                <b>Mediating Among Parents and Teenagers: </b>Mediation can
                support teens and their parents to help improve boundary
                setting, communication, and mutual respect. This high-conflict
                period can be draining, and building a toolbox filled with
                coping strategies and collaboratively constructed agreements can
                help support families.

                <br /><br />
                <b>Mediating Disputes Between Friends: </b>Where can longtime
                friends turn when a friendship hits a rough patch? Sometimes
                disputes are caused by spouses or siblings, or differences in
                values around money. Conflict may be centered on a specific
                incident, or may have been simmering for years. Mediation offers
                a space to have difficult conversations, appreciate different
                perspectives, and find ways to move forward constructively.

                <br /><br />
                <b>Mediating Elder Care and End of Life Decisions: </b>These
                conversations are undoubtedly difficult, but at the same time
                critical. Adult siblings often need to find ways to work with
                aging parents, some of whom might have diminished capacities, or
                a desire to ignore the inevitable. Mediation offers a valuable
                resource for efficient, productive conversations as well as a
                way of supporting each other through these challenging times.

                    >Mediating Ongoing Financial Support of Adult High-Needs
                    Children: </b
                >Whether a child has special needs or hasn’t left “the nest” at
                the appropriate time, this situation can cause an inordinate
                amount of stress and conflict for siblings and parents.
                Mediation can support and constructively help families during
                these difficult situations.

                <b>Conflict Coaching: </b>This is a one-on-one process to help
                an individual develop and refine listening, empathizing, and
                problem solving skills. Transparency is often a critical part of
                mediation, and in a one-on-one setting, clients can learn to
                appreciate its value. If someone feels stuck in a conflict,
                sometimes individual coaching can lead to growth and change.
                change.
