      <h2>My Background</h2>
      <p>
        For many years, my personal life was dominated by raising six children,
        who are now 24, 22, 20, 17, 15 and 13 years old. From 1995 until 2008 I
        worked as a journalist, first as an editor, and eventually as a weekly
        columnist for The New York Sun, covering parenting and child rearing
        issues. I was a regular commentor on CBS Morning News and Fox News and
        lectured at local schools.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        In 2008, I joined my father in his work at The Steinhardt Foundation for
        Jewish Life, where I helped to start entrepreneurial organizations such
        as Hebrew Public and OneTable. In this period, I learned firsthand about
        organizational structures, conflicts, and mergers. As board chair of
        numerous non-profit organizations and schools, I learned to listen,
        embrace my greatest critics, prioritize organizational goals, and work
        collaboratively with staff and board members. I learned when to lead and
        when to follow. I also learned about the specific joys and challenges of
        working in a family setting. In 2015, after 20 years of marriage, I made
        the difficult decision to get divorced. With six children, this period
        of my life was agonizing. I learned quite a bit about conflict and
        harnessing creativity during this difficult period. I worked with
        mediators, lawyers, and therapists and learned firsthand about the
        benefits and drawbacks of each.

        In 2020, I began an MS in Negotiation and Conflict Resolution at
        Columbia University. I studied conflict and power theories, dynamical
        systems theory, distributive bargaining, integrative negotiation,
        intractable conflict, and mediation. I learned about the outsized role
        emotions play in conflict. Conflict is exhausting and confusing, and one
        of the advantages of the mediation process is that it allows people to
        sort through their thinking. I was inspired by social psychologist
        Evelin Lindner, an expert in emotional awareness and regulation.

          She wrote: We have to learn to move back and forth, get into the
          othersâ€™ perspective and feelings, and then step back into our own
          perspective. We must learn to stay calm and use frustration creatively
          with imagination and inspiration. For that we need to nurture
          qualities of curiosity, courage, and patience in ourselves and in
          others.</i

        We need to learn to start with recognizing each other, and then move
        toward reconciliation and resolution. For some people this is more
        natural than for others. But everyone can grow.
      </p>
      <p>
        When I finished the degree in 2022, I noticed there was a gaping hole in
        the field in the services offered to high-net-worth families. Lawyers
        and therapists are clamoring to offer their services to this clientele,
        who are often struggling to navigate estate planning, intergenerational
        transfers of wealth, philanthropic foundations and ventures, high-worth
        family businesses, and other aspects of life that are unique to wealthy
        families. In my own personal experiences, lawyers are not always
        incentivized to work to resolve conflict quickly and constructively, and
        therapists have very little training in conflict resolution.
      </p>
      <p>
        In 2023, I opened a practice dedicated to serving all people, but
        particularly families like my own, that have had the blessing and
        sometimes curse of extraordinary wealth. My aim is to help clients
        navigate through conflict, but also to transfer the kind of listening,
        collaborating, and negotiating skills that result in independence from
        needing intervention in the future.
