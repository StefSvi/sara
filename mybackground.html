      <h2>My Background</h2>
            <p>
                Sara Bloom is a mediator who specializes in resolving complex
                disputes involving family, friends and finances. She works at
                the Long Island Dispute Resolution Center and maintains a
                private practice in Manhattan. She has her master's degree in
                Negotiation and Conflict Resolution from Columbia University,
                and has trained under leading experts in the fields of adult
                family mediation, eldercare, and conflict coaching.

                Sara spent 20 years working in the entrepreneurial philanthropic
                space, helping to found organizations such as Hebrew Public,
                OneTable and the Areivim Philanthropic Group. Through her work
                in her family's foundation, she learned firsthand about
                organizational structures, conflicts, and mergers. As board
                chair of numerous non-profit organizations and schools, she
                learned to listen, embrace her greatest critics, prioritize
                organizational goals, and work collaboratively with staff and
                board members. She learned about the specific joys and
                challenges of working in a family setting.

            <p>
                Before this, Sara was a weekly columnist for the The New York
                Sun, writing about raising her six children in New York City.

            <br />
            <p>
                Sara dedicates herself to her clients and makes difficult
                conversations productive. Her aim is to help clients navigate
                conflict but also develop long lasting listening,
                collaborating,and negotiating skills that result in independence
                from needing intervention in the future. Her clients describe
                her as compassionate, efficient, responsive and practical.
