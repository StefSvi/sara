        <b>Bloom Mediation and Consulting (BMC)</b> is dedicated to helping
        families, friends, and family businesses resolve their disputes in an
        efficient, productive manner. Is there a family that hasn’t been
        challenged by a falling out over children struggling with financial
        inequalities, siblings disagreeing on how to care for elderly parents,
        and multi-generational transfers of businesses and wealth?
      </p>

        Conflict is inevitable. What is not inevitable is having disputes that
        ruin families or valuable friendships. When complicated, emotionally
        charged conflicts arise in families or among close friends, there is not
        an obvious path to take toward resolution. Calling a lawyer begins an
        adversarial, expensive process. Few therapists are trained in conflict
        resolution, and the same is true of most clergy. Many people dread
        heated conversations, and feel these encounters are often unbalanced,
        leaving people more frustrated and angrier than they did before
        attempting to clear the air.
      </p>
      <br />

        There are countless consultants dedicated to helping improve the
        functionality of a business. They are brought in to advise best
        practices, achieve specific goals, and offer guidance in turbulent
        times. But for most of us, our families and close friends are the key to
        our happiness. What happens when conflict interferes with a family’s
        ability to celebrate together, enjoy multi-generational gatherings,
        support each other, and in some cases work together?
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        Decades of research has shown that the quality of family bonds matter
        more to overall happiness than income levels. When these bonds are
        strong and peaceful, studies have shown that there is reduced stress and
        anxiety. People living in family conflict and prolonged disputes among
        close friends are at a greater risk for depression.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        BMC offers a confidential, constructive way to navigate conflict, even
        when it feels the conflict is intractable.
