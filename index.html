                <b>Manhattan Mediation</b> is dedicated to helping families,
                friends, and colleagues resolve their disputes in an efficient,
                productive manner. Is there a family that hasn’t been challenged
                by a falling out? Sometimes it’s because children are struggling
                with financial inequalities, siblings are disagreeing on how to
                care for elderly parents, or there are multi-generational
                transfers of businesses and wealth.

                Conflict is inevitable. What is not inevitable is having
                disputes that ruin families or valuable friendships. When
                complicated, emotionally charged conflicts arise, there is not a
                clear path toward resolution. Calling a lawyer begins an
                adversarial, expensive process. Few therapists are trained in
                conflict resolution, and the same is true of most clergy. Many
                people dread heated conversations, and feel these encounters are
                often unbalanced, leaving people more frustrated and angrier
                than they did before attempting to clear the air.

                There are countless consultants dedicated to helping improve the
                functionality of a business. They are brought in to advise best
                practices, achieve specific goals, and offer guidance in
                turbulent times. But for most of us, our families and close
                friends are the key to our happiness. What happens when conflict
                interferes with a family’s ability to celebrate together, enjoy
                multi-generational gatherings, support each other, and in some
                cases work together?

            <br />
            <p>
                Decades of research has shown that the quality of family bonds
                matter more to overall happiness than income levels. When these
                bonds are strong, studies have shown that there is reduced
                stress and anxiety. People living in family conflict and
                prolonged disputes among close friends are at a greater risk for
                depression.

                and successful way to navigate conflict, even when it seems
                intractable.
