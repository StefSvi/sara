      <h2>My Approach</h2>
      <p>
        One of the early pioneers in the field of organizational behavior at the
        turn of the 20th century was Mary Parker Follett. In her most famous
        work from 1925, Follett outlines a scenario in which she is sitting in a
        library comfortably, and an older person wants to open the window near
        where she is seated. Parker Follett doesn’t want to open the window.
        Before I studied the field of conflict resolution, I would have told you
        that agreeing to alternate between opening and shutting the window would
        be a good outcome to the disagreement. But Follett explains that this
        outcome leaves both sides equally unhappy part of the time and is not
        the best we can do. She writes: <br />
      </p>

      <p>
        <i>
          "We opened the window in the next room, where no one was sitting. This
          was not a compromise because there was no curtailing of desire; we
          both got what we really wanted. For I did not want a closed room, I
          simply did not want the north wind to blow directly on me; likewise
          the older occupant did not want that particular window open, he merely
          wanted more air in the room."</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        Most people assume conflict is bad, but in our work, we will together
        realize that conflict is neither good nor bad. Sometimes conflict is
        unavoidable, but we always have a choice as to how we respond and engage
        in the conversation. Follett writes that conflict is “here in the world,
        as we cannot avoid it, we should, I think, use it…we can set conflict to
        work and it do something for us.” This idea of conflict as an engine for
        change is one that captivates me. We know that friction in a machine
        leads to a kind of energy. Similarly, friction in our life does not
        necessarily have to lead to a negative outcome; maybe friction can lead
        to something positive.

        The important question to consider when there is a dispute is: Can we
        reframe our conflicts as mutual problems to be resolved, that integrate
        both the desires and interests of different parties? Follett wrote that:
      </p>
      <p>
        <i
          >“conflict is resolved not through compromise, but through
          invention.”</i
        >
      </p>
      <p>
        I hold out hope that this is possible and have faith in our capacity to
        be creative together.
